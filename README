puppet-tribily

This is the puppet-tribily module.

This module allows you to easily monitor your servers with tribily server monitoring (available from http://tribily.com)

To add this module, add this module and the puppet-apt module (from https://github.com/Tribily/puppet-apt) to your puppet repository and add "include tribily" to all your nodes. That should do the trick!

Feedback is more then welcome!
